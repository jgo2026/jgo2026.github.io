        <h2>What is K-pop?</h2>
        <p>Kpop stands for Korean popular music. It is most commonly known as K-pop which is mainstream music that originated in South Korea.</p>
        <p>Numerous distinct musical genres and aspects fall under the banner of K-pop. It may also include Korean rock, hip-hop, and electronic music in addition to Korean pop. K-pop is regarded as a relatively new genre of music. </p>
        <p>Different K-pop music concepts are created using many different genres. Like how most K-pop groups have a designated rapper and include English words into the South Korean lyrics of the song.</p>
        <p>In K-pop choreographies, members frequently alter positions throughout a routine while performing hard-hitting, synchronized moves. This tactic is known as jaribaggum, which translates to "formation change" in English.</p>
        <p>The movements are also intended to be monotonous and visually appealing, fitting the theme of each song. This phenomenon is known as the "point dance," or "pointeu anmu," and it caused select dances and tunes to become particularly popular.</p>
        <h2>What makes a K-pop idol?</h2>
        <p>K-pop idols are musicians and groups that have been created by a variety of entertainment businesses with the aim of appealing to younger audiences. A group of individuals who are all extremely skilled in at least one of the following—singing, rapping, and dancing—come together to form the music groups.</p>
        <p>These idols frequently start working in the entertainment industry when they are still in their teens, and they work hard for years to perfect their singing, rapping, dancing, and linguistic skills. If they are fortunate and good enough, they may then be chosen for an idol group by the time they are in their late teens.</p>
        <p>The K-pop groups then release albums and singles of catchy music from time to time. For a month to two months, they will perform their lead single at numerous music festivals each week. Although the song is crucial, the group members' looks, the choreography, and the music video are always given significant consideration.</p>
        <p>This combination illustrates the selected stylistic idea for each era. Some can argue that these entertainment organizations assemble the ideal idol group attitude and style for each cycle of performing and promoting the song like manufacturers do.</p>
        <h2>Why is k-pop so popular?</h2>
        <p>Since the early 2000s, South Korean pop music has become extremely well-known because to the internet and the development of social media. South Korean music is growing in popularity as it becomes more widely available. They gradually surface in local news and television programs from many nations as well as on social media.</p>
        <p>Every K-pop group debut and comeback (a K-pop group or solo artist releasing new music) is marketed in the media with a particular theme and hook to spark public interest in listening to the new song.</p>
